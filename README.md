# Live-chat-room

I built a real-time chat room using JavaScript and Firebase Firestore, allowing the user to send and receive message instantly. The web app features multiple chat rooms, user name customization, and message timestamps for enhanced user experience.

Key Features:

Real-time Messaging: Users can send and receive messages instantly.
Multiple Chat Rooms: Users can switch between different chat rooms, such as General, Studies, Music, and Gaming.
Username customization: Users can update their display names, which are saved in the local storage.
Dynamic UI Updates: The interface updates automatically when new messages are sent or received.
